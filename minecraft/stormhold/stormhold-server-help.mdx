## World Features & Exploration

### Content Spread Across the World

Stormhold is intentionally **spread out**. Important structures, lore locations, resources, and machines are placed throughout the world rather than concentrated at spawn. Exploration is a core part of progression, and you’re encouraged to travel, discover ruins, settlements, and hidden builds.

If something seems far away or hard to find—that’s by design. Bring supplies, mark coordinates, and treat the world like a living map waiting to be uncovered.

## Create Mod Guidelines

### Contraptions Must Have a Kill Switch

All **Create contraptions** that use rotation, power, or automation **must include a way to be safely turned off**, such as:

- A lever
- A clutch
- A redstone cutoff

This helps prevent server lag, runaway machines, and accidents during maintenance or roleplay. If your contraption moves, spins, farms, or processes items automatically, make sure someone can shut it down easily.

If you’re unsure how to add a cutoff, ask in chat or on Discord—someone will usually be happy to help.

<Note>
  This way, the server will not lag if you are not on. Certain contraptions approved by Admins may remain on, but you must ask Admins in-game so they can take a look.

## Stargates & Interdimensional Travel

### Need Help With a Stargate?

Stargates are powerful tools within Stormhold and may involve setup, addresses, power requirements, or lore considerations.

If you need help setting up or understanding a **Stargate**, contact:

**Kai (The President)**

Kai can assist with:

- Stargate placement
- Address configuration
- Power or mod interactions
- Lore-friendly usage

Please don’t guess or force a setup if you’re unsure—asking first helps keep things stable and immersive.

## Getting Help In-Game

If you’re stuck, confused, or unsure about something:

- Ask in **global chat** politely
- Check the **Stormhold documentation** if available
- Reach out to leadership or staff when needed

Stormhold is a community-driven server. Helping each other is part of the experience.

## Final Notes

- Explore freely, but build responsibly
- Always include safety measures on machines
- Ask before using powerful or world-altering systems
- Respect the world, the lore, and other players

Enjoy your journey through Stormhold.
