description: "The heart of automation and industry.

Create introduces rotational power, mechanical machines, and moving contraptions that redefine how automation works in Minecraft."
---

#### Getting Started

- Generate rotation using **Water Wheels** or **Windmills**
- Transmit power with **Shafts, Gearboxes, and Belts**
- Start small with:
  - Mechanical Press (plates)
  - Millstone (grinding)
  - Crushing Wheels (ore processing)

#### Power Systems

- **Water Wheels** – early-game, reliable
- **Windmills** – scalable mid-game power
- **Steam Engines** – late-game, controlled power

#### Core Machines

- Mechanical Press
- Mixer
- Millstone
- Encased Fan
- Sequenced Gearshift

#### Server Tips

- Keep machines **compact and chunk-aligned**
- Avoid infinite loops or constantly moving contraptions
- Smaller factories = smoother TPS
