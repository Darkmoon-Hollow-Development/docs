title: "Discord & Bots"
---

Discord is where the community connects in real time. It’s the main space for conversation, support, collaboration, and shared experiences.

Our Discord bots help keep the server running smoothly. They assist with moderation, role management, announcements, logging, and other automated tasks that improve organization and safety. This allows staff to focus on supporting the community rather than managing repetitive work.

Bots also help connect Discord to our other platforms. They can provide quick access to guides, share updates, and keep information synced across systems. Their purpose is not to replace human interaction, but to support it.

Discord is meant to feel welcoming, active, and easy to participate in — whether you’re here to talk, ask questions, or just hang out.
