## Step 1: Start with the Website

The website is the best place to begin. It acts as the central hub for documentation, guides, rules, and important announcements.

Spend a little time browsing the pages to understand how things are structured. Knowing where information lives will save you time later and make the experience smoother.

Whenever you’re unsure where to look for official information, the website should always be your first stop.

## Step 2: Join the Discord

Discord is where the community lives day to day. It’s the best place to talk with others, get support, and stay up to date.

When you join, make sure to read the welcome messages and rules. These exist to keep the space friendly, safe, and enjoyable for everyone.

If you’re not sure where to start chatting, that’s completely fine. Many channels are designed specifically for questions, introductions, or casual conversation.

## Step 3: Get the Minecraft Modpack (If Applicable)

If you’re here to play, installing the Minecraft modpack is your next step. Download links and setup guides are available on the website to walk you through the process.

Follow the instructions carefully and double-check the required version. This helps prevent connection issues and crashes.

If you run into problems, support is available through the documentation and the Discord community.

## Step 4: Ask Questions and Get Involved

No one is expected to know everything right away. Asking questions is encouraged, and helping each other is part of what makes the community strong.

You can get involved at your own pace — by chatting, playing, sharing ideas, or simply being present. Every level of participation is welcome.
