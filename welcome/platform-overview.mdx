title: "Platform Overview"
---

Our community is built across multiple platforms, each designed to support a different part of the experience. No single tool carries everything on its own. Instead, our systems work together to create a space that is welcoming, organized, and easy to navigate for everyone.

This documentation exists to help you understand how our platforms connect and why we use them. Whether you’re new to the community or a long-time member, this overview explains how everything fits together and where to go when you need something.

At the center of everything is the community itself. The platforms we use are meant to support creativity, gameplay, conversation, and collaboration. They are chosen with long-term stability and accessibility in mind, so the experience remains consistent and enjoyable over time.

As you explore the rest of the documentation, each page will focus on a specific platform and explain how it contributes to the overall ecosystem.
