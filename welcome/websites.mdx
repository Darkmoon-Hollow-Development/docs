Our websites serve as the foundation of the community. They act as the most reliable and permanent source of information, ensuring important content is always accessible and easy to reference.

This is where you’ll find documentation, guides, rules, announcements, downloads, and helpful resources. Unlike chat-based platforms, the website allows information to be structured, searchable, and preserved over time.

The website helps keep everything organized and fair. By centralizing important information, everyone has equal access to the same resources, regardless of when they joined or how active they are in chat.

Whenever you’re unsure where to look for official information, the website should always be your first stop.
